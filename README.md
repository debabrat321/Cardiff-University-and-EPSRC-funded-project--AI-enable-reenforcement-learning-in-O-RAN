This project explores the implementation and analysis of a Federated Learning system within Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) environments. Federated Learning is a privacy-preserving approach where multiple participants train local models on their data and share only the model updates with a central server, ensuring data confidentiality.

Key components of the project include:

Federated Tool: Implemented using Python and Flask, this tool enables local model training and centralized aggregation of model updates.
Simulation System: Facilitates testing of various machine learning algorithms, including LSTM, GRU, and NN, with and without Differential Privacy.
Privacy Preservation: Focuses on protecting data through anonymization and differential privacy techniques.
Results: Evaluated load prediction and anomaly detection, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and privacy.
The project addresses both technical and non-technical challenges and suggests future work for enhancing scalability and improving privacy-preserving methods.
