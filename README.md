Introduction
Federated Learning is a novel machine learning approach that enhances privacy by anonymizing the learning process. Instead of sharing raw data, participants contribute their local models to an aggregation server, maintaining data confidentiality while building a global model.

Background
Federated Learning
Federated Learning allows multiple data sources to collaboratively train a global model while keeping data localized. This method addresses privacy and security concerns inherent in traditional centralized learning.

Privacy Preservation and Differential Privacy
Privacy preservation in machine learning employs techniques like anonymization and encryption to protect sensitive data. Differential Privacy ensures that the inclusion or exclusion of individual data does not significantly affect the analysis output, providing robust privacy guarantees.

Python Flask
Flask is a lightweight Python web framework used for developing web applications and APIs. It is integral to the implementation of our federated learning system.

Dataset
The dataset, generated for 5G cellular networks, includes fields such as data rate, network area information, subscription categories, and personal equipment ID. The data simulates real-world network traffic and anomalies.

Literature Review
The literature review section explores existing research on federated learning, privacy preservation, and differential privacy.

Design & Methodology
Federated Tool
The federated tool is implemented in Python using Flask. It facilitates federated learning by allowing multiple clients to train local models and send updates to a central server for aggregation.

Design
The tool consists of two main classes: FlaskServer and FlaskClient. The server handles client initialization, updates, and model aggregation. The client loads and preprocesses data, trains local models, and communicates updates to the server.

Methodology
Initialization: Clients and server are initialized with necessary parameters.
Local Training: Clients train their local models on their respective data.
Model Updates: Clients send their local models to the server.
Federated Averaging: The server averages the local models to update the global model.
Iteration: Steps 2-4 are repeated for a set number of rounds.
Evaluation: The global model is evaluated using a test dataset.
Simulation System
The simulation system allows for testing various algorithms in a controlled environment, bypassing network constraints.

Design
The system includes classes like BaseServer, LSTMServer, GRUServer, and corresponding client classes, facilitating different machine learning models.

Methodology
Initialization: Server and clients are initialized with dataset and model parameters.
Local Training: Clients train local models on their data batches.
Federated Averaging: The server aggregates the client models.
Global Update: Updated global model is sent to clients.
Iteration: Process repeats for a set number of rounds.
Evaluation: The final global model is evaluated for performance.
Results & Discussion
Load Prediction
Various algorithms were tested for load prediction, including LSTM, GRU, and NN, both with and without Differential Privacy. The results showed that models with Differential Privacy had slightly higher error rates but maintained robust privacy protection.

Anomaly Detection
Initial experiments with anomaly detection provided insights into the dataset and helped refine the models for better performance.

Challenges
The project faced technical challenges like network scaling and non-technical challenges such as time constraints and resource limitations.

Future Work
Future work will focus on enhancing the scalability of the federated learning system, improving anomaly detection models, and exploring additional privacy-preserving techniques.
